I have been trying to reinvent the way I do HTML and CSS and as such I followed the guide of Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) as his explanations of structure and variable conventions completely clicked with how I like to do work. Much thanks to Kevin Powell for giving me invaluable information I will apply to future projects.
